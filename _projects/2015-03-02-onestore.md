As a TF member, we spearheaded the incorporation of joint venture company (ONE Store corp.) with three major telecom operator (SK Telecom, Korea Telecom, LG U+) as well as the leading web portal NAVER, to consolidate and operate their app stores. After, we initiated and led the preliminary **ONE Store project**, the integration of the infra system among three major telecom operator app stores, based on SK planet ecosystem(T store), by devising a strategy to separate the developer ecosystem and customer base, establishing collaboration scheme.

During this project, I was in charge of CMS integrations like collecting and merging App data as well as communicating with stakeholders, creating new policies, and announcing to developers. 


### The achievements

Because of this innovation, ONEstore platform was able to gain 10 million more active users. 
In addition, I improved the function to expose ONE store's Apps/Games to the search queries of Naver and increased the PV/UV A tremendously compared with the previous version.
