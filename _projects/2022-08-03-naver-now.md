**Background**

**NAVER TV** is a YouTube-like video platform, which was released in 2012. And **NAVER NOW** is a live service that streams original contents produced by NAVER, and has been creating Tiktok-like portrait video content with K-pop artists such as BTS and BlackPink since 2019.

2021, NAVER decided to start a project to integrate these two services into **NAVER NOW**. As a product designer, I got an opportunity to join this integration journey and played a key role in various projects. Especially, I'd like to highlight the `TOP-Featured-List project` that I worked on in 2022 and successfully solved user and business problems.



## Problems

![Portfolio.034](../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.034.png)

NAVER has been surfaced the featured content list of NOW contents at its sub products, like main page, for users to engage more and stay longer sessions on NAVER services. However, after NTV-NOW integration, this NOW-featured widgets across NAVER products were inconsistent and outdated. This resulted in unhelpful UIs and broken journeys.

The root cause of this problem was disadjustment. The two video services look similar at first glance, but the details were completely different.

| Difference       | NAVER NOW             | NAVER TV                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Content type** | (Only) LIVE stream    | Video clip, <br />LIVE Stream<br />Sports Broadcasting<br />and more. |
| **Orientation**  | (Only) Portrait       | Portrait<br />Landscape<br />Square                          |
| **Partners**     | (Only) NAVER Original | Creator (3rd party)<br />TV Broadcasts<br />Strategic partners (HIVE, YG ent.) |



At the beginning of this integration project, we handed over the featured-APIs used by existing services, but we quickly decided to change our course of the action because we found lots of limits. Not only did this feature not satisfy the different needs of users, but it also couldn’t address the business needs of our partners.

That’s why we decided to create a new feature that fits the new integrated environment.


## Process

This feature area was the most important UI component in the app and at the same time a very sensitive feature that affected widgets used by other NAVER products. When I get this kind of ambiguous, broad project, having a process helps me get clarity on how to break down the big design problem and also helps me prioritize these smaller tasks based on the impact that our team wants to drive.

The process that I used to solve this problem was the Double Diamond Process.

### Discover phase

The first step was to go wide and explored the problem space a little bit more. 

In the Discover phase, I tried to drill down into what the user and business problems are. I also thought about the current design such as what is working well, and what isn't working well. 

Especially, we tried to understand qualitative and quantitative data. For qualitative data, unfortunately, we didn't have enough time for any user research or a survey to understand key pain points that come up from users. Instead, my team decided to do a competitive analysis that can also be really insightful. 

The role that I had in this phase was leading small group of product designers and extracting insights from quantitative data, I did my best to find any metric that helps me know how the current design is performing.

	images = "../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.015.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.016.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.017.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.018.png"
%}



### Define phase

After we went wide and have a better understanding of the problem space, I narrowed down and decided what the team should actually fix. In this Define phase, we did synthesize our findings and insights from the competitive analysis and quantative data, and started deciding and prioritizing what our team is going to work on. 

**Key Finding**

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = false
	images = "../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.021.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.022.png"
%}



**Users prefer the carousel compare to scroll-down**

According to user data, we found that the proportion of navigating content using carousel components in areas where users can see at a glance when they first turned on the app is significantly higher than other content that needed scrolling down. For example, in some case, the click event count of 3rd item on scroll down area were dropped below 30%.



**Some users skipped the browsing.**

Another interesting user behavior was that a significant number of app users skip content discover, immediately enter the content detail page, and leave the app as soon as the content ends. After checking the user segment a little further, I found that those users consumes TV content, such as sports broadcasts and news. Which meant that recommending only K-pop original content won’t help improve conversion rates for this kind of user group.



**Hold-Preview interaction.**

Users are very familiar with 'hold-Preview'. Even new users of the Naver Now app also spend a lot of time preview section of the featured items, just like using YouTube or Netflix. That’s why interaction using previews is an important UX that plays a big role in entering detailed pages or improving conversion rates.

<br/>

After we pointed out those findings, I did many sessions and workshop to collaborate with other product teams such as  the product managers, operators, and SW engineers to figure out feature prioritization, product requirements, and more. 



### Develop phase

The Develop phase was where I went wide again in my explorations of design solutions. Before jumping straight into the design, I did brainstorm my ideas on my WIKI note based on server spec because I didn't want to spend too much time overthinking them and trying to perfect my initial ideations.

| Problem space                                        | Assumption                                                | Idea (**Pick**)                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Users prefer the carousel compare to scroll-down** | Users are already familiar with the video carousel UX<br />(Shorts, Reels, Netflix, etc.)<br /><br />Poor performance of our video recommendation algorithm | **<u>Add carousel component</u>**<br /><br />Enhance the recommendation algorithm<br /><br />Redesign the recommendation list page |
| **Some users skipped the browsing.**                 | Different user segments have different preferences for content or user behavior | **<u>Featured various content categories</u>**<br /><br />Enhance personalization by user segment |
| **Hold-Preview interaction.**                        | Users are already familiar with the preview UX<br /><br />Critical Interactions Affecting Content Consumption | **Enlarge the content or type that can be previewed**<br /><br />**Preview provided even in the feature area** <br /><br />Add parallax animation for content that cannot be previewed |



After thinking about many ideas, the solution I chose was to add **a Netflix-style carousel component**. I also decided to expand the Spec so that not only original LIVE content, but also VOD clips or sports sports cards can be posted on this component. Of course, all item cards are designed to be previewed for up to 15 seconds.

![Portfolio.027](../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.027.png)



Next, I wrote a Wiki document that included my solutions, wiresframes, and low fidelity mockups. Finally, I continued to collaborate with teams like visual design, engineering, and service management for feedback and validating my design solutions.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = false
	images = "../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.023.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.024.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.025.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.026.png"
%}

Moreover, I also designed the admin tools. Because the feature list is a very sensitive area, the service operations team hoped to thoroughly manage this list on an hourly basis. So I not only created tools that make scheduling easier for the service operations team, but also the one-click function to make card items.



{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = false
	images = "../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.028.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.029.png"
%}



### Deliver phase

The final step is to go narrow and refine my solutions. In the deliver phase, My team and I tried to figure out what was going to be actually shipped. So this requires a lot of user testing. We did serveral rounds of usability testing to ensure that my design solution was going to have the impact that we initially wanted to have and that it was actually solving the real user and business problem. And based on that feedback, we made a bunch of iterations on Figma.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = false
	images = "../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.030.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.031.png,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.032.png ,../images/projects/2022-naver-now/Portfolio.033.png"
%}

And I also shared my designs to the broader team, like the service operation team, NAVER app team, a lot of cross-functional partners to better understand how this design solution were going to impact the business and the other aspects of the business. I'd say I did spend majority of my time in the last phase because I made a lot of iterations based on the feedback from my team and visual design sessions.



### Design system thinking 

While sketching for design solutions, we studied NAVER's design system to find existing patterns and UI components to ensure consistency and clarity. Since there were no pre-established patterns, we worked on new ones. 



## Takeaway

We successfully finalized the development of this new carousel component and it will shipped on Aug. 2022 (expected). There's certainly a lot that could be improved. I believe in learning and iterating by shipping often and early.

I learned a lot not only through this project, but also throughout the entire NAVER NOW integrated project. Designing integrated product comes with many constraints. For example, each services (NOW, NAVER TV, and more) has different content strategies, business goals, and user needs. Moreover, it took time and effort to understand different stakeholders’ requirements and reach alignment. It was a humbling experience to learn that sometimes things take long for good reasons.
