### Project background

Most people working in the Internet service industry have the same habit of checking statistics on a daily basis through tools like Google Analytics. And I thought this pattern was inconvenient. I believed that if we could connect the Google Analytics API with messengers like Kakaotalk or LINE, which Koreans and Koreans use every day, we would be able to free people from this annoying routine and started the project with the node js study team.
