## 💡 The Ideation Journey

The Mirror of Your Mind (명심보감/明心寶鑑) is a book that encapsulates the wisdom of Eastern philosophy. It teaches that to live a truly human life, one must broaden their learning, maintain a sincere purpose, never lose curiosity, keep questioning, and solve problems step by step. These teachings resonate deeply with us, product designers, living in the 21st-century digital and AI age. After all, it’s crucial to maintain a positive mindset even in **moments of change**.

<br/>
In a cozy nook of a Starbucks in western Singapore, two Grab designers, [DY LEE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dy-lee/) and [Jude Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dusskapark/), kicked off what was just a humble AI side project. It wasn’t about achieving something monumental; it was about confronting the genuine anxieties of diving into AI, maintaining a hopeful perspective, and exploring new avenues for growth in an AI-driven landscape.

<span class="timeline-date">Jan 2024: The Question</span>
### Can AI Enhance Design?

As we move through 2024, AI is everywhere, and it’s changing how we work in design. Every day, new AI tools and models are emerging, transforming the way we approach our work. We initially thought AI would take over the boring tasks, freeing us to focus on creativity. However, AI is now involved in everything from generating creative content to designing user interfaces, reshaping our processes obviously.

In light of these changes, we found ourselves asking:

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
{% include post-components/quote.html
   full_width = false
   background_color = "#000"
   font_color = "#fff"
   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/6_design_process_4.png"
   text = "<span class='typeIt' style='font-size: 24px; background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 2px 4px;'>How can we embrace the power of AI in our design process?</span> <br/><br/>Beyond just automating tasks, what role can AI play in supporting us as designer assistants?"
%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<br/>
<br/>

We didn't find the perfect answer right away, but our exploration led us to a crucial realization: being a product designer is about more than just creating visual designs. It's about identifying challenges, devising solutions, and deeply understanding user needs and behaviors.

Instead of letting AI dictate our design decisions, we began to explore how we could harness its power to strengthen our insights and gain a deeper understanding of user behavior. This shift in perspective opened up new possibilities, leading us to discover Tencent's research on AppAgent - a finding that felt perfectly timed for our needs.

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

Tencent’s research team introduced AppAgent, a multi-modal agent capable of interacting with apps naturally. Using LLM and Android Studio, AppAgent demonstrates how AI can explore apps and use gestures like a human.

As designers, we found ourselves captivated by AppAgent’s remarkable ability to simulate user behavior. It was as if we were watching real users interact with an app, tapping and swiping their way through the interface. This AI-driven mimicry of human interaction not only sparked our curiosity but also opened our minds to new creative possibilities.

%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<br/>
<br/>

The idea of leveraging AI-generated user flows and behaviors in our UX research was compelling. It promised a more efficient way to address user challenges and conduct iterative testing, allowing us to refine our designs with greater precision.

To bring this vision to life, we knew we needed insights from our peers. We reached out to fellow designers, eager to gather their perspectives and explore how AppAgent could revolutionize our design process.

<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-date">Feb 2024: The Validation</span>
### Designer Interviews

We wanted to understand how AI & AppAgent could naturally fit into our design process, so we spoke with 10 designers across 7 teams over two weeks. Our goal was to uncover the challenges they face and see where AppAgent might offer solutions.

![Our interview journey: we spoke with 10 designers across 7 teams over two weeks](../images/projects/2024-klever/6_design_process_5.png)

From these interviews, we uncovered three key insights:

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
⏳ <span style="font-size: 16px; background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 2px 4px;">Research is Time-Consuming</span> 
User research often requires significant time and resources.

🤷‍♂️ <span style="font-size: 16px; background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 2px 4px;">Lack of Alternatives</span>

AppAgent could greatly improve the speed and quality of usability testing.

</div>

AI is not a magic wand that solves every problem. The key is understanding how AI can add real value to the design process. Through conversations with designers, we discovered the potential for AppAgent to positively transform the way we design.

</div>

<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-date">Mar 2024: The Vision</span>
### Instant Usability Testing

We decided to set out to create a seamless connection between design and testing with AppAgent. Typically, testing designs requires organizing user sessions and justifying the time and resources involved. Convincing engineers to test different versions can also be a hurdle. However, what designers really want to know is — **“Is this design delivering a great user experience?”**

By integrating AppAgent with Figma’s prototype screens, we envisioned a tool that could answer those kinds of questions more easily.

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}  
{% include post-components/quote.html
   full_width = false
   background_color = "#000"
   font_color = "#fff"
   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/6_design_process_6.png"
   text = "How might we let AI act as real users to help designers get insights without recruiting and interviewing?<br/><br/>What if AI could behave like a persona, exploring designs just as a human would?<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 24px; background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 2px 4px;'>AI instant usability testing</span>, that's our answer."
%}
<br/>

This isn’t just about passing or failing a QA test. It’s about using AI to mimic real user interactions, allowing it to navigate through designs and suggest optimal paths with minimal clicks, or to point out areas that need refinement. AppAgent performs heuristic evaluations on prototypes, delivering clear and actionable insights without requiring lengthy business justifications.

Our task now is to bring this concept to life.

## 🛠️ The Development Journey

Integrating AppAgent with Figma's prototype feature presented several significant technical hurdles. As this started as a small side project by designers, expanding from an Android app to Figma required us to overcome multiple complex challenges.

<div class="timeline-section full-width align-right">
<div class="outer">
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-date">Mar 2024: Understanding</span>
### How AppAgent Works?

Our initial challenge was to grasp the fundamental workings of AppAgent. The original AppAgent operates in a cycle of Observation, Thought, and Action, iterating multiple times.

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
{% include post-components/gallery.html
   columns = 1
   full_width = false
   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_vid_0.png"
   caption="The original AppAgent operates: Observation → Thought → Action"
%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

AppAgent provides a screenshot with UI annotations and a task to the GPT-4-vision model, which observes, thinks, and suggests the next action. This process repeats, simulating user interaction.

To adapt this for Figma prototypes, we faced two critical challenges:

- **Creating screenshot images and annotations for UI elements in Figma prototypes**
- **Implementing the AI model's suggested actions within Figma prototypes**

Understanding these core operations was essential to integrating AppAgent with Figma, setting the stage for our development journey.

</div>

<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-date">Mar 2024: Experimenting #1</span>
### Generating UI Screenshots & Annotations

Creating screenshot images and annotations in Figma prototypes wasn't too difficult. We used Figma's REST API to fetch node data from Figma design, convert it to images, and generate screenshot images and annotations.

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
{% include post-components/gallery.html
   columns = 1
   full_width = false
   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_case%20study_1_0.png"
   caption="A sample screenshot vs A screenshot with UI object annotations"
%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

However, implementing the resulting actions in Figma prototypes proved challenging. This was because Figma prototypes render their designs on `<Canvas>` like PNG images, making it difficult to recognize and interact with just UI components.

</div>

<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-date">Mar 2024: Experimenting #2</span>
### Implementing AI Actions in Figma

The solution was [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). As a tool for controlling web browsers and interacting with web page UI elements, we created a `SeleniumController` to control Figma prototypes at the web browser level.

```python
# AppAgent/scripts/figma_controller.py

class SeleniumController:
   def __init__(self, url, password):
       self.url = url
       self.password = password
       self.driver = None

   def execute_selenium(self):
       options = Options()
       options.add_argument("user-data-dir=./User_Data")
       options.add_argument("disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled")
       options.add_argument("--start-maximized")
       options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)

       service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
       self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options)

       self.driver.get(self.url)
       # ...
```

By structuring the SeleniumController similarly to the AndroidController, we enabled control over Figma prototypes. We integrated this with the existing logic to run it as a new option, distinct from the Android-based approach.

### From experiment to product, <span style="background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 2px 4px;">Klever</span> was born

As we shared our prototype with the design community, we received enthusiastic responses about its potential. However, we also discovered a significant challenge: **the Python development environment was a major barrier** for many designers who wanted to try it out.

This feedback led us to make a **BOLD** decision. We decided to develop a Figma plugin version, transforming our experimental implementation of Tencent's paper into a more accessible product for all product designers.

This evolution needed a new identity, and that's how 'Klever' was born.

In developing the Klever plugin, we faced many technical challenges. The biggest challenge was how to implement AppAgent's core functionality in the limited environment of a Figma plugin. Some notable challenges include:

- **Transition to TypeScript**
- **Development of the UIs**
- **Utilizing Figma Plugin API**

It wasn't easy for us, designers, to code it to overcome these challenges as well, but we developed the Klever plugin while tackling these difficulties with Copilot. And through this, we made it possible to use AppAgent's core functionality in Figma plugins as well.

   full_width = false
   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_case study_1_1.png, ../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_case study_1_2.png"
   caption="AI Agent found a prototype noodle that the designer missed."
%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

In a travel app prototype, we asked the AI agent to check promotions and find the cheapest hotel in Bali. Contrary to our expectations, the AI agent tried to expand the article by clicking the center instead of pressing the ‘Read more’ button or the search button. This is a familiar UI pattern used in many apps, but it was mistakenly not connected in this prototype. The AI agent captured this important interaction that the designer had missed.

   caption="AI Agent discovered the confusing visual design of the UI components."
%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

On the hotel details screen of the same prototype, we instructed the AI agent to find more information. We expected the AI to expand the article for ‘Read more’, but it repeatedly clicked the ‘Detail’ tab instead. This shows that the AI agent, like a person, confused tabs and buttons due to their similar visual designs. It highlights how the AI agent can spot visual design details that the designer might have overlooked.

<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-date">Use Case #3</span>
### Predicting Hidden Features

AI Agent predicted the next UI and performed the action.

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
{% include post-components/gallery.html
   columns = 2
   full_width = false
   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_case study_3_1.png, ../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_case study_3_2.png"
   caption="AI Agent predicted the next UI and performed the action."
%}
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

In a task to change the number of guests to 10, the AI agent clicked the ‘2 guests’ area instead of pressing the ‘+’ button. Despite being given only a single screen, the AI predicted that clicking this area would reveal additional options. This shows that the AI can understand and predict common UI patterns, not just process the given information.

</div>
</div>
</div>

These cases demonstrate that this AI-based usability testing agent can think and act like a real user, not just follow programmed rules. It provides insights that are as valuable as those from actual users. These moments were the most thrilling and fascinating for us as creators.

### Conference: InfCon 2024 Presentation

Shortly after releasing the Figma plugin, an unexpected opportunity came our way. [Kim Ji-hong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jihere1001/) from [Design Spectrum](https://medium.com/u/d906e16642cf) and [Hong Yeon-ui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeoneui-hong/) from [Inflearn](https://medium.com/u/785769823235), who had been following our project with interest, invited us to speak at [InfCon 2024](https://www.inflearn.com/conf/infcon-2024/).

<br><br>
Most importantly, we extend our heartfelt thanks to the Korean designers who showed interest in our project and asked endless questions late into Friday evening. The support and energy we received from InfCon 2024 were truly uplifting.

### From Side Project to Corporate Innovation

Encouraged by the community's response, we took on our biggest challenge yet: convincing Grab's design leadership to adopt our experimental project. From Tech Day presentations to leadership meetings, we delivered more than 6 different presentations and demos. By August, we had participated in over 20 stakeholder meetings, each one bringing us closer to our goal. After months of persistence and countless iterations, our dedication paid off.

![Klever Internal Demo](../images/projects/2024-klever/5_demo_vid_1.gif)

This evolution from a side project to a corporate-backed initiative validates our vision of AI-powered usability testing and provides a platform for more ambitious experiments:

- Access to enterprise-level AI capabilities
- Ability to collect and analyze usage data at scale
- Opportunities to test with a larger designer base

While this corporate adoption was a significant milestone, we soon faced another challenge that would push us to think even bigger.

### Challenges & Community Growth

As our project grew, we encountered a significant technical hurdle. The Klever plugin was limited to performing usability tests on only one screen, as Figma's API constraints made it impossible to replace Selenium for controlling prototype flows.

   images = "../images/projects/2024-klever/figma_config_1.jpeg, ../images/projects/2024-klever/figma_config_2.jpeg, ../images/projects/2024-klever/figma_config_3.jpeg"
   caption = "My efforts to overcome Figma API limitations: <br/>From meeting with Figma AI team to discussing with Dylan Field, Figma CEO"
%}

We went to great lengths to address these API limitations, even meeting with Figma's AI team and eventually discussing our needs with Dylan Field, Figma's CEO. Despite these high-level conversations and our persistent requests for new APIs, the technical constraints remained.

Rather than letting this limitation stop us, we saw an opportunity to expand our impact. We decided to open-source our project, believing that by sharing our challenges openly, we could not only find potential solutions but also inspire others to build upon our work. This decision to embrace open collaboration has already led to unexpected innovations and improvements.

The community's response has been incredibly encouraging. Developers and designers from various backgrounds have started experimenting with our codebase, proposing creative solutions to overcome the current limitations. One particularly promising approach involves integrating the Figma plugin with a Python Flask server:

## Lessons learned

This project started as a small side project for designers to learn AI while having fun. There were many challenges in the experimental process, but we received interest and encouragement from various designers and communities and motivated by all of that, we persistently repeated our experiments and eventually achieved the result of making it into a product.

In the era of AI, new AI tools are pouring out every day. Some may feel pressured to learn new things, Or some may feel a vague fear that AI will replace our design jobs. But what this project has taught us is that AI is fascinating and fun. If we learn while playing and work while learning, just like children playing with interesting toys, and improve the small inconveniences in our product design ecosystem with AI, AI will no longer be a difficult or scary entity.

We hope that these fun experiences we felt are well conveyed to all of you reading this article. So, enjoy a fun design experience with AI! 🤗
